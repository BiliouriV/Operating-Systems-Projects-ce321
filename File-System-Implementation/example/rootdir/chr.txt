Dear Editor,
I am writing with regard to the article entitled, “Cellphones Banned in Schools”
that appeared in your newspaper yesterday. I am a high school student and
I would like to express my opinion on the government’s new rule about
cellphones.
First of all, I would like to say that the Department of Education is completely
wrong. In my opinion, banning cellphones in schools is not a good idea. I believe
students need cellphones to keep in contact with their parents during the day and
after school. If I know, for example, that I am going to be late, I use my cellphone
to call my parents and let them know. Also, if an emergency comes up, students
can use their cellphones to get help.
I would like to add I agree that it isn’t right for students to send messages during
lessons. I believe cellphones should be switched off in class. However, I think
that using a cellphone at school is no reason to be suspended. Furthermore,
teachers have also been seen using their cellphones during class time. In my
opinion, something should be done about that too.
I hope that my letter will be published and that my views will be taken into account.
Yours sincerely,
Panos Pappas

Dear Editor,
I am writing in response to the article I read in yesterday’s newspaper
about student representatives to an international exhibition. I would like
to nominate my friend, Stephanie Dimou.
I believe Stephanie would make an excellent representative of our city
because she has many of the necessary qualities and qualifications. First of
all, she speaks English perfectly. She received both the ECCE and the
ECPE certificates. She also speaks Italian quite well. She has lived in our
city all her life and knows its history. She loves our town and also likes
talking to people, so I believe she would be able to persuade people to
visit our town or even come to study at our university.
In addition, Stephanie is a hard-working person. She would have no
problem working at the exhibition all day. Also, she is a beautiful girl with
a happy personality. She would certainly attract people to our city’s booth
both with her lovely face and her bright smile. Finally, I know that
Stephanie would love to travel abroad but her family’s financial
circumstances are difficult, so she would appreciate this opportunity to
travel and receive payment for her work.
Thank you for the opportunity to nominate my friend to represent our city.
I hope she is chosen because I believe she would do an excellent job.
Yours sincerely,
Eleni Jones
