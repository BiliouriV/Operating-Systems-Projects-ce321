Cellphones are very popular today. It would be hard to find a teenager who
doesn’t have one. In my opinion, cellphones have become a necessity for
teens, but I do agree that they are often used at the wrong times and in the
wrong places.
Cellphones are useful and even vital for teens today in several ways. First,
parents can be in contact with their children at any moment with the
cellphone. Teens today have so many after-school activities and they often
need to be picked up or driven somewhere. If they are early or late, they need
to be able to contact their parents. In addition, there are many dangers in
society today. Having a cellphone allows teens to call the police or their
parents for help.
On the other hand, teenagers don’t seem to be able to part with their
cellphones. They use their cellphones to listen to music, take photos and
videos, play games, send messages and many other things, so it seems that
teens are constantly busy with them. In my view, there should be some places
where they are not allowed. The classroom, for example, should be a
cellphone-free area. If students are concentrating on the lesson, then they
shouldn’t be using their cellphones.
In conclusion, I believe that cellphones are important tools that make teens
and their parents’ lives easier. However, their use should be restricted in
some places like the classroom.
