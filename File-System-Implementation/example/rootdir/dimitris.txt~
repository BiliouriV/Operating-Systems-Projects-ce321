Dear Editor,
I am writing with regard to the article entitled, “Cellphones Banned in Schools”
that appeared in your newspaper yesterday. I am a high school student and
I would like to express my opinion on the government’s new rule about
cellphones.
First of all, I would like to say that the Department of Education is completely
wrong. In my opinion, banning cellphones in schools is not a good idea. I believe
students need cellphones to keep in contact with their parents during the day and
after school. If I know, for example, that I am going to be late, I use my cellphone
to call my parents and let them know. Also, if an emergency comes up, students
can use their cellphones to get help.
I would like to add I agree that it isn’t right for students to send messages during
lessons. I believe cellphones should be switched off in class. However, I think
that using a cellphone at school is no reason to be suspended. Furthermore,
teachers have also been seen using their cellphones during class time. In my
opinion, something should be done about that too.
I hope that my letter will be published and that my views will be taken into account.
Yours sincerely,
Panos Pappas

Cellphones are very popular today. It would be hard to find a teenager who
doesn’t have one. In my opinion, cellphones have become a necessity for
teens, but I do agree that they are often used at the wrong times and in the
wrong places.
Cellphones are useful and even vital for teens today in several ways. First,
parents can be in contact with their children at any moment with the
cellphone. Teens today have so many after-school activities and they often
need to be picked up or driven somewhere. If they are early or late, they need
to be able to contact their parents. In addition, there are many dangers in
society today. Having a cellphone allows teens to call the police or their
parents for help.
On the other hand, teenagers don’t seem to be able to part with their
cellphones. They use their cellphones to listen to music, take photos and
videos, play games, send messages and many other things, so it seems that
teens are constantly busy with them. In my view, there should be some places
where they are not allowed. The classroom, for example, should be a
cellphone-free area. If students are concentrating on the lesson, then they
shouldn’t be using their cellphones.
In conclusion, I believe that cellphones are important tools that make teens
and their parents’ lives easier. However, their use should be restricted in
some places like the classroom.
