Dear Editor,
I am writing with regard to the article entitled, “Cellphones Banned in Schools”
that appeared in your newspaper yesterday. I am a high school student and
I would like to express my opinion on the government’s new rule about
cellphones.
First of all, I would like to say that the Department of Education is completely
wrong. In my opinion, banning cellphones in schools is not a good idea. I believe
students need cellphones to keep in contact with their parents during the day and
after school. If I know, for example, that I am going to be late, I use my cellphone
to call my parents and let them know. Also, if an emergency comes up, students
can use their cellphones to get help.
I would like to add I agree that it isn’t right for students to send messages during
lessons. I believe cellphones should be switched off in class. However, I think
that using a cellphone at school is no reason to be suspended. Furthermore,
teachers have also been seen using their cellphones during class time. In my
opinion, something should be done about that too.
I hope that my letter will be published and that my views will be taken into account.
Yours sincerely,
Panos Pappas
